1.Implement the following circuit:

2.Implement the following circuit:

3.Implement the following circuit:

4. Build a combinational circuit with two inputs, a and b.
   There are 7 outputs, each with a logic gate driving it:
   
5.The 7420 is a chip with two 4-input NAND gates. Create a module
  with the same functionality as the 7420 chip. It has 8 inputs and 2 outputs.

6.Create a combinational circuit that implements the above truth table.

7.Create a circuit that has two 2-bit inputs A[1:0] and B[1:0], and produces an output z.
  The value of z should be 1 if A = B, otherwise z should be 0.

8.Module A is supposed to implement the function z = (x^y) & x. Implement this module.

9.Circuit B can be described by the following simulation waveform:

10.See mt2015_q4a and mt2015_q4b for the submodules used here. The top-level design consists
   of two instantiations each of subcircuits A and B, as shown in figure.

11.Suppose you are designing a circuit to control a cellphone's ringer and vibration motor.
   Whenever the phone needs to ring from an incoming call (input ring), your circuit must either 
   turn on the ringer (output ringer = 1) or the motor (output motor = 1), but not both. If the
   phone is in vibrate mode (input vibrate_mode = 1), turn on the motor. Otherwise, turn on the ringer.
   Try to use only assign statements, to see whether you can translate a problem description into a
   collection of logic gates
   
12.A heating/cooling thermostat controls both a heater (during winter) and an air conditioner (during summer).
   Implement a circuit that will turn on and off the heater, air conditioning, and blower fan as appropriate
   
13.A "population count" circuit counts the number of '1's in an input vector. Build a population count circuit 
   for a 3-bit input vector.
   
14.You are given a four-bit input vector in[3:0]. We want to know some relationships between each bit and its neighbour:

15.You are given a 100-bit input vector in[99:0]. We want to know some relationships between each bit and its neighbour:
