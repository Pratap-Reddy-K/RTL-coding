```````````
1.Create a module with one input and one output that behaves like a wire.

2.Create a module with 3 inputs and 4 outputs that behaves like wires that makes these connections:
  a -> w
  b -> x
  b -> y
  c -> z
  
3.Create a module that implements a NOT gate.

4.Create a module that implements an AND gate.

5.Create a module that implements a NOR gate.

6.Create a module that implements an XNOR gate.

7.create a inverter module by decalarinng wires.

8.The 7458 is a chip with four AND gates and two OR gates.
  Create a module with the same functionality as the 7458 chip.
  It has 10 inputs and 2 outputs. You may choose to use an assign 
  statement to drive each of the output wires, or you may choose to
  declare (four) wires for use as intermediate signals, where each 
  internal wire is driven by the output of one of the AND gates.
