1.Given four unsigned numbers, find the minimum. 

2.Create a circuit that will compute a parity bit for a 8-bit byte (which will add a 9th bit to the byte).
  We will use "even" parity, where the parity bit is just the XOR of all 8 data bits.
  
3.Build a combinational circuit with 100 inputs, in[99:0].
  There are 3 outputs:
  out_and: output of a 100-input AND gate.
  out_or: output of a 100-input OR gate.
  out_xor: output of a 100-input XOR gate.
  
4.Given a 100-bit input vector [99:0], reverse its bit ordering.

5.A "population count" circuit counts the number of '1's in an input vector. Build a population count circuit
  for a 255-bit input vector.
  
6.Create a 100-bit binary ripple-carry adder by instantiating 100 full adders. The adder adds two 100-bit 
  numbers and a carry-in to produce a 100-bit sum and carry out.
  
7.Instantiate 100 copies of bcd_fadd to create a 100-digit BCD ripple-carry adder. Your adder should add two 
  100-digit BCD numbers (packed into 400-bit vectors) and a carry-in to produce a 100-digit sum and carry out.
